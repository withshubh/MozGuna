## What are we doing?

### The problem

* Lack of participation in technical activities and poor knowledge of Open Source among students in schools & universities in Guna.
* No active technical community in Guna region to promote Open Source or Mozilla.
* There may be potential contributors to Open Source who are not getting a right platform to start with or don't know how to start with.

### The solution

The MozGuna will:

* Initiate the first ever active technical Open Source Community to promote open source and bring out technical contribution from university girls in Guna.
* A community that hosts workshops around Guna schools & Universities to provide knowledge about Open Source & Mozilla and how contributing to Mozilla and Open Source will benefit them.
